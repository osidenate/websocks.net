I'm Nathan Nelson. I'm a software engineer working at Pearson Education and I live in Scottsdale, AZ. Most of my current work involves front-end development.
 
I spend my free time learning more about software development and working on engineering side projects. I'm an active person. I like strength training and going mountain bike riding. Sometimes I find myself doing a set of push-ups during code breaks.

I grew up in Oceanside, CA and moved to Arizona in 2008 in order to attend Arizona State University to study Computer Science. After graduating, I worked on a variety of different software projects before deciding to focus on front-end development.
