  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’m Nathan Nelson. I’m a software engineer working at Pearson Education and I live in Scottsdale, AZ. Most of my current work involves front-end development.</p>

<p>I spend my free time learning more about software development and working on engineering side projects. I’m an active person. I like strength training and mountain bike riding. Sometimes I find myself doing a set of push-ups during code breaks.</p>

<p>I grew up in Oceanside, CA and moved to Arizona in 2008 in order to attend Arizona State University. I studied Computer Science. After graduating, I worked on a variety of different software projects before deciding to focus on front-end web development.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h3>

<p>This purpose of this site is to serve as a place for me to record my thoughts and opinions on software development. Sometime I’m researching a topic or tool and I want a place to keep notes. This blog is a place for me to write down my thoughts in order to help me learn the concept. I document what I learned in my blog so that refer to it in the future.</p>
